Below is a list of the variables included in this datasheet and brief descriptions of what they are/how they were derived and what units they are if applicable,
,
pedon_ID,"number of sampled pedon, 2-73"
horizon,"horizon of sampled pedon: litter, o, a, e, b, c"
location,common name of sample pedon
state,state pedon was collected in
latitude_longitude_full,full lat/long
latitude,latitude of collection
longitude,longitude of collection
depth_inches,depths of horizon thicknesses in inches

total_depth_sampled_inches,the lowermost depth of entire soil profile/predon collected
region,"Northeast, Midwest, West, North West, Pacific Coast, Southwest, Central, Southeast, "
soil_order,"Soil order: mollisol, inceptisol, entisol, alfisol, andisol, aridisol, vertisol, gelisol, ultisol"
dominant_vegetation_class,"Major groupings based on common vegetation listed in OSD and what was observed on location. Used to group samples into ""biomes"". Groups are: deciduous hardwood forests, coniferous forests, mixed hardwood and coniferous forests, grasses, shrubs, tussock sedges and forbes"
soil_moisture_regime,"based on common vegetation listed in OSD in soil family designation and what was observed on location: aquic, udic, ustic, aridic, xeric,"
